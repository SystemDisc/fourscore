              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Chase Oliver might argue that while infrastructure improvements in underserved neighborhoods are important, the best approach is to encourage private investment and community-led initiatives rather than relying on government funding. He might suggest that reducing regulatory barriers and offering incentives for private companies to invest in these areas could lead to more sustainable and efficient outcomes. Oliver could emphasize the importance of local control and decision-making, ensuring that any infrastructure projects are driven by the needs and priorities of the community members themselves. He might also highlight the role of public-private partnerships in addressing infrastructure needs without overburdening taxpayers.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his Libertarian principles, Oliver might assign a moderate importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 50-60%.

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Jill Stein would likely argue that zoning changes to allow more affordable housing developments are essential for addressing the housing crisis, reducing homelessness, and promoting social and economic equity. She might emphasize that access to affordable housing is a fundamental human right and a key component of a just society. Stein could advocate for policies that ensure affordable housing is available to low-income families, minorities, and other marginalized groups who are disproportionately affected by housing shortages and high costs. She would likely highlight the environmental benefits of well-planned affordable housing developments, such as reducing urban sprawl and promoting sustainable communities. Stein might also stress the importance of community involvement in planning and implementing these zoning changes to ensure they meet the needs of local residents.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given her focus on social justice and sustainability, Stein would likely assign a very high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 80-90%. This reflects her belief that affordable housing is crucial for creating equitable and sustainable communities and that zoning changes are necessary to make housing more accessible and just for all residents.`,

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Chase Oliver might argue that while education is important, the city offering free community college tuition is not the most effective or sustainable solution. He could suggest that government-funded programs often come with high costs and inefficiencies. Instead, Oliver might advocate for policies that encourage private sector involvement, such as scholarships, grants, and partnerships with businesses that can provide funding for education. He could emphasize the importance of promoting competition and innovation in the education sector to drive down costs and improve quality. Oliver might also stress the need for individuals to take personal responsibility for their education and seek out opportunities through private means rather than relying on government programs.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his Libertarian principles, Oliver might assign a moderate importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 40-50%. This reflects his recognition of the importance of education while maintaining a strong emphasis on reducing government intervention and promoting private sector solutions.`,

He might emphasize that such policies could lead to increased government spending and higher taxes.

He might also highlight the importance of partnerships between businesses and educational institutions to provide targeted training programs that prepare students for high-demand careers. Trump could suggest that scholarships and grants funded by the private sector or through public-private partnerships might be a better approach than universally free tuition.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his focus on economic growth and fiscal conservatism, Trump might assign a moderate importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 50-60%.

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Chase Oliver might argue that while mental health services are important, the city should focus on creating an environment that encourages private sector involvement and community-based solutions rather than expanding government-funded programs. He could suggest that deregulating the healthcare sector and reducing bureaucratic barriers would allow for more innovative and cost-effective mental health services. Oliver might emphasize the role of non-profits, charities, and private organizations in providing mental health support, arguing that these entities can often address community needs more efficiently than government programs. He could also advocate for policies that empower individuals to take control of their mental health through access to a variety of service providers and options.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his Libertarian principles, Oliver might assign a moderate importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 50-60%. This reflects a recognition of the importance of mental health services while maintaining a strong emphasis on reducing government involvement and promoting private sector and community-driven solutions.`,

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Cornel West would likely argue that expanding mental health services accessible to the public is essential for promoting social justice, reducing disparities in healthcare, and improving overall community well-being. He might emphasize that mental health is a critical component of public health and that many underserved communities lack adequate access to mental health care. West could highlight the importance of providing comprehensive mental health services, including counseling, crisis intervention, and preventative care, to address the needs of all residents, particularly those who are marginalized and economically disadvantaged. He would likely advocate for increased funding for mental health programs, training for mental health professionals, and community-based initiatives to ensure that mental health services are accessible, affordable, and effective.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his focus on social justice and public health, West would likely assign a very high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 90-100%. This reflects his belief that expanding mental health services is crucial for creating a more equitable and compassionate society, addressing systemic healthcare inequalities, and ensuring that all individuals have the support they need to thrive.`,

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Donald Trump would likely argue that expanding mental health services is important for addressing public health and safety issues, particularly in relation to crime and homelessness. He might emphasize that effective mental health services can reduce the burden on law enforcement and emergency services. Trump could highlight the importance of public-private partnerships to expand mental health services, leveraging private sector efficiency and innovation while maintaining government oversight. He might also stress the need for responsible fiscal management, ensuring that any expansion of services is cost-effective and sustainable. Additionally, Trump could advocate for streamlining existing programs to eliminate waste and improve service delivery.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his previous administration's focus on public safety and economic efficiency, Trump might assign a moderate to high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 60-70%. This reflects his recognition of the importance of mental health services for public safety and well-being, balanced with a focus on fiscal responsibility and efficient use of resources.`,

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Chase Oliver would likely argue against the implementation of stricter gun control measures within city limits. He might emphasize the importance of upholding the Second Amendment rights of individuals to own and carry firearms. Oliver could argue that law-abiding citizens should not have their rights infringed upon due to the actions of a few individuals. Instead, he might advocate for focusing on enforcing existing laws more effectively and addressing the root causes of violence, such as mental health issues and economic inequality. He could also highlight the importance of personal responsibility and the role of community-based initiatives in promoting safety.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his Libertarian principles, Oliver would likely assign a very high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 80-90%. This reflects his strong belief in protecting individual liberties and the right to self-defense, which are core tenets of Libertarian ideology.`,

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Cornel West would likely argue that implementing stricter gun control measures within city limits is essential for reducing gun violence and enhancing public safety, particularly in underserved and marginalized communities that are disproportionately affected by gun violence. He might emphasize the need for comprehensive gun control policies that include background checks, restrictions on the sale of high-capacity magazines and assault weapons, and measures to prevent illegal gun trafficking. West could also highlight the importance of addressing the root causes of violence, such as poverty, lack of education, and inadequate mental health services, alongside stricter gun control measures. He would likely advocate for a holistic approach to public safety that combines sensible gun regulations with social and economic initiatives to create safer and more just communities.

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Chase Oliver might argue that while access to Wi-Fi is important, the city should not be responsible for providing free public Wi-Fi. Instead, he could suggest that the private sector is better equipped to offer such services. Oliver might emphasize that private businesses, such as coffee shops, libraries, and other establishments, often provide free Wi-Fi as a service to attract customers. He might also argue that public-private partnerships could be a more effective way to expand Wi-Fi access without increasing government spending. Oliver could advocate for reducing regulatory barriers to encourage competition and innovation among internet service providers, leading to more affordable and widespread internet access.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his Libertarian principles, Oliver might assign a moderate importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 40-50%. This reflects a recognition of the importance of internet access while maintaining a strong emphasis on reducing government intervention and promoting private sector solutions.`,

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Chase Oliver might argue that while renewable energy is important for the future, the decision to invest in such technologies should not be made by the government but rather left to the private sector and market forces. He might suggest that if renewable energy sources are economically viable, businesses and individuals will naturally adopt them without the need for government investment. He could also emphasize the importance of reducing overall government spending and taxes, allowing the private sector more freedom to innovate and invest in renewable technologies independently.

**Percentage of Importance:** Oliver might assign a relatively low importance to this issue in terms of government action, possibly in the range of 20-30%. This reflects a belief that the role of the government should be limited and that market-driven solutions are preferable. He would likely prioritize policies that reduce government intervention and foster a more free-market approach to energy and environmental issues.`,

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Trump would likely argue that while renewable energy can be part of the overall energy mix, the city should prioritize investments that ensure energy reliability and economic growth. He might express concerns about the costs associated with transitioning to renewable energy and emphasize the importance of maintaining energy independence through the use of traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas, and coal. Trump could also highlight the need to balance environmental goals with economic considerations, suggesting that any investment in renewable energy should not come at the expense of taxpayers or local businesses.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his emphasis on traditional energy sources and economic growth, Trump might assign a relatively low importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 20-30%. This reflects his prioritization of economic considerations and skepticism about the immediate benefits of investing heavily in renewable energy for public buildings.`,

He might emphasize the importance of supporting businesses that contribute to environmental sustainability, public health, and social equity. Kennedy Jr. could advocate for targeted tax incentives that prioritize green businesses, clean energy startups, and enterprises that offer fair wages and benefits.

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Chase Oliver might argue that while the concept of community policing has potential benefits in fostering better relationships between law enforcement and communities, any increase in funding should be carefully considered and justified. He could suggest that community policing initiatives need to focus on accountability, transparency, and the protection of civil liberties. Oliver might emphasize the importance of local control and community input in determining how police resources are allocated and stress the need for efficient use of taxpayer dollars. He could also advocate for alternative approaches to public safety that involve community-led initiatives and partnerships with private organizations to enhance security and trust without expanding government power.

              notes: String.raw`**Answer:** Joe Biden would likely argue that expanding public parks and green spaces is essential for creating healthy, vibrant, and resilient communities. He might emphasize the benefits of such spaces in terms of improving public health by providing areas for exercise and recreation, enhancing mental well-being, reducing urban heat islands, and improving air quality. Biden would also highlight the importance of equitable access to these spaces, ensuring that all neighborhoods, particularly underserved and marginalized communities, have access to quality parks and green spaces. He could point to his administration's investments in infrastructure and community development as part of a broader strategy to promote sustainable urban development.

**Percentage of Importance:** Given his administration's focus on climate action, infrastructure improvement, and community well-being, Biden would likely assign a high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 70-80%. This reflects his belief in the multifaceted benefits of public parks and green spaces for urban environments and their role in promoting environmental and social equity.`,

He may also express concern about the potential social and health implications of legalization but stop short of calling for a federal ban on states that choose to legalize it.\n" +

He could assign a moderate level of importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 30-40%, reflecting a stance that recognizes the ongoing national debate and the complexity of enforcing federal laws against a growing number of states that have chosen to legalize it.",

                '**Answer:** Trump might argue that while education is important, the focus should be on creating diverse educational opportunities and empowering students through choice rather than solely investing in state-funded scholarship programs. He may support scholarship programs that align with these values, such as those targeting vocational training or merit-based scholarships, rather than broad, state-funded programs aimed at all students.\n' +

                '**Percentage of Importance:** Given his emphasis on school choice and reducing federal spending on traditional educational pathways, he might assign a moderate importance to this issue, focusing more on how such programs are structured rather than opposing them outright. The importance might be in the range of 30-50%, depending on how these scholarships align with broader educational choice initiatives.',

He might suggest that such expansion could lead to increased federal and state spending and potentially burden taxpayers without necessarily providing better healthcare outcomes. He might advocate for alternative solutions that involve the private sector and encourage more competition to lower healthcare costs.\n' +

This reflects his broader agenda of seeking to dismantle parts of the ACA and reduce the size of government-funded health programs in favor of market-driven approaches.",

He could argue that enhancing broadband access aligns with efforts to support American workers and businesses, especially in sectors like agriculture that are predominant in rural areas.\n' +

This reflects an understanding of the strategic significance of broadband for economic growth, competitiveness, and the quality of life in rural communities, which were key constituencies during his presidency. However, the exact prioritization could vary based on how proposals are framed in terms of economic benefits and alignment with broader policy goals.',

The percentage of importance might be in the range of 40-50%, acknowledging his administration's efforts in this area while also considering his overall emphasis on stringent law enforcement and punishment for certain crimes.",

He might suggest that the focus should be on creating a favorable economic environment that naturally increases wages through competition and economic growth, rather than imposing federal mandates.\n' +

This reflects his broader economic philosophy that leans towards deregulation and free-market principles. He might prioritize other economic measures that he believes would more effectively stimulate job creation and economic growth over a federally mandated wage increase.',

He might emphasize the importance of individual liberties and the potential negative impacts of what he might perceive as government overreach.\n' +

                "**Percentage of Importance:** Given his administration's actions and his public statements, Trump might assign a low importance to enacting more comprehensive anti-discrimination laws, possibly in the range of 10-20%. This reflects his broader agenda focused on deregulation, economic considerations, and a particular interpretation of individual freedoms over expanded government mandates for anti-discrimination protections.",

                "**Answer:** Trump would probably argue that more stringent regulations on Wall Street and financial institutions could hinder economic growth, reduce competitiveness, and negatively impact job creation. He might emphasize the importance of a free-market economy with minimal government intervention as essential for fostering innovation and maintaining a strong economy. His administration's actions, such as rolling back parts of the Dodd-Frank Act—a comprehensive set of financial regulations implemented after the 2008 financial crisis—underline this stance.\n" +

                "**Percentage of Importance:** Trump would likely assign a low importance to the implementation of more stringent regulations, viewing deregulation as a higher priority. The importance he'd assign to opposing increased regulations on Wall Street could be quite high, possibly around 80-90%, reflecting his administration's emphasis on deregulation as a means to support economic growth.",

                '**Answer:** Trump might acknowledge the importance of supporting families and the potential benefits of paid parental leave for child development and family stability. He could suggest that while the federal government can play a role in encouraging paid parental leave, the implementation details should offer flexibility to businesses to avoid undue financial burdens, especially on small businesses. The approach could involve tax incentives for companies that offer paid leave or a limited federal program rather than a broad, one-size-fits-all mandate.\n' +
                '\n' +
                "**Percentage of Importance:** Given the mixed signals and the balance between recognizing the need for family support while considering economic impacts, Trump might assign a moderate level of importance to this issue, potentially around 40-50%. This reflects an acknowledgment of the issue's relevance but tempered by concerns over economic implications and the preference for market-driven rather than government-mandated solutions.",

                '**Answer:** Trump might argue that while voting rights are important, the primary concern should be ensuring the integrity and security of elections, often suggesting that this is best managed at the state level rather than by increasing federal involvement. He has frequently claimed, without evidence, that voter fraud is a significant issue that threatens election integrity. Therefore, he might stress measures aimed at securing elections, possibly suggesting stricter identification requirements or other safeguards.\n' +
                '\n' +
                '**Percentage of Importance:** Given his focus on election integrity and claims of widespread voter fraud, he would likely consider the topic important, but his emphasis would be on measures that align with his perspective rather than broadly expanding federal oversight to protect voting rights in the way the question implies. Thus, the percentage of importance he might assign could be relatively high, perhaps 70-80%, but framed within the context of preventing fraud and maintaining state control over elections rather than expanding federal protections in the traditional sense.',

                '**Answer:** Trump would likely express strong opposition to a single-payer healthcare system, arguing that it would lead to inefficiencies, long wait times for patients, and stifle innovation in healthcare. He might emphasize that a free-market approach would provide better choices for Americans, encourage competition, and lead to higher quality care.\n' +
                '\n' +
                '**Percentage of Importance:** Given his strong opposition to extensive government involvement in healthcare, he would likely consider this issue of high importance, especially as it contrasts sharply with his preferred policies. The importance level might be in the range of 80-90%, reflecting his emphasis on opposing healthcare reforms that move towards single-payer or substantially increase government control over healthcare.',
