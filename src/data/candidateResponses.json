    "notes": "**Answer:** Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would probably favor zoning changes to allow more affordable housing developments. He would likely emphasize the importance of addressing the housing affordability crisis, which affects many American families. Kennedy might argue that reforming zoning laws can help create more inclusive communities by increasing the supply of affordable housing. However, he would also stress the need for these developments to be environmentally sustainable and to include community input to ensure that they meet local needs and do not lead to negative social or environmental outcomes. Kennedy might advocate for smart growth principles that encourage mixed-use developments, the preservation of green spaces, and the integration of affordable housing in a way that benefits the entire community.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given his focus on social equity and environmental issues, Kennedy would likely assign a high importance to this issue, understanding that affordable housing is a critical component of social justice and community well-being. He might consider this issue to be around 70-75% important, reflecting its significance in creating equitable and sustainable communities.",

    "notes": "**Answer:** Trump has consistently supported the fossil fuel industries, including coal, oil, and natural gas. He has expressed skepticism about the economic viability and reliability of renewable energy sources. Therefore, he would likely disagree with the idea that the federal government should invest more in renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Instead, he might argue for an 'all of the above' energy strategy that includes continued support for fossil fuel industries along with some investment in renewable energy. He would likely emphasize the need to protect jobs in the fossil fuel industries and maintain US energy independence.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given his focus on economic growth and energy independence, Trump would likely assign a significant importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 70-80%. This reflects his belief that energy policy is a critical component of economic policy and national security.",

He believes in advocating for the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, and would strongly support a nationwide policy that reinforces the legalization of same-sex marriage. He has often spoken about the importance of love, dignity, and respect for all people, and these beliefs would undoubtedly guide his position on this issue.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given his history of activism and advocacy for equality, West would likely assign a high degree of importance to this issue. The percentage could possibly be in the range of 85-95%, reflecting his belief in the importance of equal rights and justice for all people, including those in the LGBTQ+ community.",

As a libertarian, he typically supports less government interference in private business decisions and favors free-market solutions. He might suggest that businesses should have the freedom to offer paid parental leave as part of their benefits package if they choose to do so, without government coercion. However, he could also advocate for federal policies that encourage businesses to offer paid parental leave voluntarily, such as tax credits or other incentives.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given his libertarian principles, Oliver might assign a high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 70-80%. This reflects his belief in the importance of reducing government interference in private businesses while also supporting families and workers.",

Harris may also highlight the need to invest in other aspects of national security such as diplomacy, international alliances, and cybersecurity. She would likely stress the importance of not only increasing the defense budget but also ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given her focus on a broad range of policy areas, Harris would likely assign a moderate to high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 50-60%. This reflects her belief that while national security is crucial, other policy areas also deserve substantial attention and investment.",

This stance is likely informed by his own family's tragic experiences with gun violence, as well as his larger focus on social justice issues. He might argue that stricter gun control laws are necessary to prevent gun violence and save lives, but that such measures must also respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Kennedy could also advocate for measures such as universal background checks, restrictions on the sale of assault weapons, and programs to educate the public about gun safety.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given the personal significance of this issue for Kennedy and its broader societal implications, he would likely assign a high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 70-80%.",

    "notes": "**Answer:** Donald J. Trump would likely not support the United States rejoining international agreements focused on combating climate change. During his presidency, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord, stating that it was not in the best interest of the American people and economy. He often expressed skepticism about the impacts of climate change and prioritized policies that promoted American energy independence.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given that this was a significant aspect of his previous administration's policy, Trump would likely assign a high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 70-80%. This reflects his belief that American energy policies should be determined by the U.S. and not international agreements.",

She has previously criticized the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and has advocated for more ambitious efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Stein might argue that rejoining international climate agreements is essential for the U.S. to demonstrate leadership on climate change and to cooperate with other countries in addressing a global problem that affects all nations. She would likely emphasize the need for the U.S. to not only rejoin these agreements, but also to commit to more ambitious emission reduction targets and to provide financial and technical support to developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n\n**Percentage of Importance:** Given her strong focus on environmental issues, Stein would likely assign a very high importance to this issue, possibly in the range of 90-100%. This reflects her belief that combating climate change is one of the most urgent and important challenges facing the world today.",

He might suggest that such a system could lead to longer wait times for medical services, less choice for patients, and less innovation in healthcare.
